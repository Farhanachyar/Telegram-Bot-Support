## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Koyeb (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy this bot is using Koyeb's one-click deployment:

[![Deploy to Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/static/images/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.koyeb.com/deploy?name=telegram-bot-support&repository=Farhanachyar%2FTelegram-Bot-Support&branch=main&builder=dockerfile&instance_type=free&instances_min=0&autoscaling_sleep_idle_delay=300)

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Use the deploy button above to connect with Koyeb
3. **Important**: You must manually add all required environment variables in the Koyeb interface:
   - `API_ID` (from my.telegram.org)
   - `API_HASH` (from my.telegram.org)
   - `BOT_TOKEN` (from BotFather)
   - `SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID` (from ChatID_HyperBot)
   - `DISCUSSION_GROUP_ID` (from ChatID_HyperBot)
   - `SUPPORT_STAFF_IDS` (comma-separated list of staff User IDs)
4. Deploy and enjoy your support bot!

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Farhanachyar/Telegram-Bot-Support.git
cd Telegram-Bot-Support
```

#### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 3: Get your API credentials
1. **API ID & API Hash**:
   - Visit [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org/auth)
   - Log in with your phone number
   - Click on "API Development tools"
   - Create a new application (fill in all required fields)
   - Your API ID and Hash will be displayed

2. **Bot Token**:
   - Start a chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
   - Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions
   - Choose a name and username for your bot
   - Once created, you'll receive a bot token

#### Step 4: Setup your channels and get required IDs

1. Create a Telegram channel for support tickets
2. Link this channel with a discussion group for staff collaboration
3. **Add your newly created bot as an admin** to both the channel and discussion group
4. Send a random message in your channel
5. Send a random message in your discussion group
6. Forward both messages to [@ChatID_HyperBot](https://t.me/ChatID_HyperBot)
7. ChatID_HyperBot will respond with the Chat IDs you need:
   - Use the channel message's Chat ID as your SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID
   - Use the group message's Chat ID as your DISCUSSION_GROUP_ID
8. For SUPPORT_STAFF_IDS, have each staff member send a message to ChatID_HyperBot to get their User IDs

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: ChatID_HyperBot is only used to retrieve the necessary IDs. Your own support bot (not ChatID_HyperBot) must be added as an admin to both your channel and discussion group.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: After successfully deploying and starting your bot, send a random message to it right away to prevent "peer ID invalid" errors. This must be done after the bot is already active.

#### Step 5: Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
API_ID=your_api_id
API_HASH=your_api_hash
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
SUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
DISCUSSION_GROUP_ID=your_group_id
SUPPORT_STAFF_IDS=id1,id2,id3
```

#### Step 6: Run the bot
```bash
python main.py
```

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

This repository includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment.
